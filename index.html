                                My name is Bilal Saeed, I began my programming carrier in 2018 with a background in Business Administration and an emphasis in Finance in Marketing. 
                                I have over 12 years of expereince in Operations Management in the healthcare industry. The world of coding has always been a long awaited journey that I have
                                been wanting to fulfil. This will be a milestone in my career to acheive success and become a full stack coder.

                            <p>
                                I plan to learn all of the standards, techniques, and the various frameworks in the industry to become an expert-level coder
                                and manage existing IT projects in a much more efficient manner. By employing a higher level of expertise in coding field will allow
                                an increased intuition and familiarize myself better with advanced programmers in the industry.
